I want to create a responsive layout where:

Above 500px screen width:

-There are two text boxes aligned vertically on the left.
-An image is displayed to the right of the text boxes, forming a side-by-side layout.


Below 500px screen width:

-The two text boxes should remain stacked vertically.
-The image should shift below both text boxes, forming a fully vertical layout.

check where is the issue
